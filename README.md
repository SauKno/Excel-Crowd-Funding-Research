  The box and whisker plot demonstrates the distribution of campaign goals and total amounts pledged for plays in Great Britain which will highlight outliers and uncover where pledges align to goals. Half of the goals for Plays inj Great Britain were less than $2000 dollars, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged. The averaged pledged was $1,046.96![CentralTendency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94129215/145697775-0a7f7c82-b2ee-47ba-8eb9-ceae08966323.png)

  
Recommendations:
  Kickstarter should be launched in May or June. The original goal fo 10,000 is an outlier for goals and pledges and therefore is highly unlikely to be achieved. The goal amount needs to be less than 4,000 pounds to even fall within the amounts that have been pledged for plays. Setting the goal closer to 2,000 pounds will move her goal closer to the average amount given by pledges. Therefore, the overall budget needs to be rewritten to fit within these parameters if she wants the highest likelihood of achieving the kickstarter goal.
